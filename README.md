#Shopify Frontend Test

This repo is just me messing around trying to build a shopify store front app.

to run it in shopify on devmode:

run `npm run ngrok`
add this ngrok proxy server to the shopify partnetr page settings for home and redirect url.
also run:
`npm run shopify:dev`

to start the server to make it work in the shopify account.

in the shoppy dashboard of the store where the app is installed check the APP section an click your app.

for more info click [link]('https://shopify.dev/tutorials/build-a-shopify-app-with-node-and-reac')

to run it locally in dev mode for just styling use `npm run dev`
pls note mocks are needed because this command doesnt hook the app up with shopify.
